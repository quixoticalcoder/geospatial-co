    Compute the final site readiness score (0–100) as a weighted sum
    of the six precomputed dimension scores.

    Formula
    -------
    site_readiness_score = Σ (dimension_score_i × weight_i)

    Also computes per-dimension weighted contributions for explainability.

    Parameters
    ----------
    precomputed_scores : PrecomputedScores
        Layer 7 scores (0–100 each).
    user_weights : WeightConfig
        Six weights summing to 1.0.
    lat, lng : float
        Coordinates for the output model.

    Returns
    -------
    SiteScore
        Final score plus contribution breakdown.
